AsyncSerf: an async Python front-end for Hashicorp's Serf
=========================================================

AsyncSerf is an asynchronous interface to `Serf <http://serf.io/>`.

Key features:

* async; uses `AnyIO <https://github.com/agronholm/anyio/>`,
  thus is compatible with ``asyncio``, ``trio`` and ``curio``.

* properly multiplexed; issue multiple commands in parallel

* listen for, and respond to, queries / user events

* transparently encodes/decodes your payloads, if desired

* should support 100% of Serf's RPC command set

* includes adequate tests and example code

* License: MIT

Inherited from `Trio <https://github.com/python-trio/trio>`_:
